[AI Assistance 11 – Global Arms Trade Network for the Storyboard]( https://chatgpt.com/c/672d253a-250c-8001-901e-8c4d8d47f2d0)
We modified the narrative for the Global Arms Trade Network in the Forced Diagram, where the United States (blue), Russia (red), and China (yellow) use arms exports to expand influence and form alliances in key regions. The U.S. supports allies in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific, while Russia focuses on Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and China strengthens ties in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South Asia. We highlighted India as an example of a multilateral partner by underlining it, as it balances relationships with the U.S., Russia, and other powers. Styling was applied directly in JSX: colors for each country, italics for regions, and underlining for India, resulting in a visually cohesive and strategic narrative that aligns with the diagram's geopolitical themes.

We refined a data visualization dashboard on the global arms trade by adjusting colors and layout for improved clarity and visual hierarchy. Key updates include moving the Pie Chart to Preparing Allies for Emerging Threats and the Zoomable Circle Packing to Countering Through Proxy Support. Additionally, we added a toggle button in Countering Through Proxy Support to switch between the Parallel Coordinates Chart and the Zoomable Circle Packing, with dynamic labels reflecting the selected view. These changes streamline user interaction and enhance the presentation of strategic alliances and trends in arms trade.

[AI Assistance 13 – README Creation](https://chatgpt.com/c/672fd8a5-555c-8001-9f05-b79c0ace787f)
We collaborated to refine the GitHub README for a Global Arms Trade Dashboard, focusing on clarity, functionality, and alignment with your DSCI 554 course. We organized data sources from SIPRI and UCDP/PRIO efficiently and developed a Design Choices section to highlight narrative structure, color-coded visuals, depth, and interactivity, drawing on principles like Gestalt theory and cognitive load reduction from your lectures. We detailed functionality for key interactive elements (sidebar navigation, tooltips, zoom/pan) and customization options, with references to the React components (.js files) that implement these features. The final document in GitHub Markdown provides a cohesive, professional summary of the dashboard’s capabilities and design rationale.

We worked on building Choropleth Map and Line Chart for the defense expenditure by country by year components using React, D3, and TopoJSON to display global defense expenditure data. The component features a choropleth map to show defense expenditure by country for a selected year, synchronized with a line chart showing historical expenditure trends for the United States, China, and Russia. We ensured compatibility of country names between the dataset and the map, applied a logarithmic color scale for better visual contrast, and added tooltips for detailed information on hover. Additionally, we positioned a legend for both the map and line chart, synchronized the line chart with the map’s year slider, and included highlighted points on the line chart to mark the selected year. Finally, we placed the line chart in the bottom right corner of the map for an integrated, responsive layout.

We worked on building a Three.js jet landing animation project within a React app, focusing on several key refinements to enhance its functionality and visual appeal. Initially, the landing arc was misoriented towards the left side of the screen, which we corrected by rotating the arc 90 degrees counterclockwise. To further improve the visualization, we flattened the arc vertically, shifted it upward by 50 units, and later adjusted it to slide down towards the bottom of the screen by modifying parameters in the getLandingPosition function. The code was modularized into a jet_animation.js file for seamless integration, utilizing React refs and the useEffect hook. Additionally, errors related to the incorrect placement of index.html in the src folder were resolved by adhering to the correct React project file structure. Finally, the jets' rotation direction was reversed to align with the desired leftward motion by tweaking the angle calculation logic. These iterative improvements ensured compatibility, resolved technical challenges, and enhanced the animation's accuracy and overall user experience.
