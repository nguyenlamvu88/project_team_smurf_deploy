We worked on building Choropleth Map and Line Chart for the defense expenditure by country by year components using React, D3, and TopoJSON to display global defense expenditure data. The component features a choropleth map to show defense expenditure by country for a selected year, synchronized with a line chart showing historical expenditure trends for the United States, China, and Russia. We ensured compatibility of country names between the dataset and the map, applied a logarithmic color scale for better visual contrast, and added tooltips for detailed information on hover. Additionally, we positioned a legend for both the map and line chart, synchronized the line chart with the map’s year slider, and included highlighted points on the line chart to mark the selected year. Finally, we placed the line chart in the bottom right corner of the map for an integrated, responsive layout.

We worked on building a Three.js jet landing animation project within a React app, focusing on several key refinements to enhance its functionality and visual appeal. Initially, the landing arc was misoriented towards the left side of the screen, which we corrected by rotating the arc 90 degrees counterclockwise. To further improve the visualization, we flattened the arc vertically, shifted it upward by 50 units, and later adjusted it to slide down towards the bottom of the screen by modifying parameters in the getLandingPosition function. The code was modularized into a jet_animation.js file for seamless integration, utilizing React refs and the useEffect hook. Additionally, errors related to the incorrect placement of index.html in the src folder were resolved by adhering to the correct React project file structure. Finally, the jets' rotation direction was reversed to align with the desired leftward motion by tweaking the angle calculation logic. These iterative improvements ensured compatibility, resolved technical challenges, and enhanced the animation's accuracy and overall user experience.
